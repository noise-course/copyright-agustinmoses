# Task 1: Platform Copyright Policy Analysis
I chose the YouTube(YT) as the platform.
**How does the platform detect copyrighted content?**
  Mainly through its automated Content ID system. Basically, Content ID creates fingerprints of audio
  and video submited by major rights holders and compares every upload against this database. This allows YT to generate
  automatic claims that can block, monetize, or track videos. Not only that, but any copyright owner can also send a 
  formal takedown request through YT’s copyright web form. If the claim is valid, it typically removes the video and issues
  a copyright strike, with the uploader able to respond via dispute or counter-notification. This is not the same as Content ID
  since Copyright strikes carry heavier penalties and can lead to termination if a user accumulates enough in set time period.
