# Task 1: Platform Copyright Policy Analysis
I chose the YouTube(YT) as the platform.\
\
**How does the platform detect copyrighted content?**\
  Mainly through its automated Content ID system. Basically, Content ID creates fingerprints of audio
  and video submited by major rights holders and compares every upload against this database. This allows YT to generate
  automatic claims that can block, monetize, or track videos. Not only that, but any copyright owner can also send a 
  formal takedown request through YT’s copyright web form. If the claim is valid, it typically removes the video and issues
  a copyright strike, with the uploader able to respond via dispute or counter-notification. This is not the same as Content ID
  since Copyright strikes carry heavier penalties and can lead to termination if a user accumulates enough in set time period.\
  \
**What happens when content is flagged as potentially infringing?**\
The video gets a “copyright” restriction and both the uploader and the rights holder are notified. For an automated Content ID match, YT immediately applies the copyright owner’s policy: block the video, monetize it for the owner instead of the uploader, or simply track its viewership. The uploader can either accept the claim, edit or mute the matched segment, or file a dispute within YouTube Studio. If the flag comes from a formal copyright removal (DMCA-style) request, YT usually removes the video and issues a copyright strike, then gives the uploader the option to submit a counter-notification.\
\
**What is the appeals or counter-notification process?**
Witht the Content ID process, the uploader can dispute it in Studio and, if rejected, may be able to file an appeal, which pushes the claimant to either release the claim or escalate to a formal takedown. If a video is removed by a copyright takedown and a strike is issued, the uploader’s escalation path is a legal counter‑notification: they submit a formal statement with contact details saying the removal was a mistake, the claimant then has a short window to start a lawsuit, and if they do not, YT usually restores the video and removes the strike.\
\
**How does the platform handle monetization of content containing copyrighted material?**\
YT usually lets copyright owners decide whether and how a video with their material earns money, via Content ID policies.\
\
**Are there any special programs (e.g., YouTube's Content ID licensing agreements)?**\
Yes

# Task 2: Fair Use Experiments
## Raw copyrighted clip:##
I uploaded 2 clips( 10 sec and 30+ sec) of The Lion King 2 which contains part of the music. After uploading, the video immediately received a copyright claim.

## Educational Use ##:

Next I upload a modified version of the 30+ sec clip with commentary on the musical structure. To disclose, I used AI for the commentary since I know nothing about musical structure. Prompt used: explain "We are one" in Lion King 2 musical structure in a couple of paragraphs. The video received the same copyright claim which I suspect is due to the music segments clips being too long.

In both cases I could try to dispute the claim, but the video was able to be kept up with no restrictions.

**Research Findings:**

- What does the AI tool’s terms of service say about copyright?\
Users can't upload copyrighted content without permission.
- Who owns the copyright to AI-generated content? (you, the AI company, the creators of training data, public domain/no one?)\
Users own the copyright to AI-generated content.
- What is your platform’s stated policy on AI-generated content?\
YouTube allows AI-generated content but requires disclosure for realistic altered/synthetic media.
